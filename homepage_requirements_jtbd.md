## **🎯 Strategy & Context**

### **Vision**

We’re reimagining the entire benefits experience as a consumer-grade, personalized, AI-assisted journey built around life events that empowers users with ease and confidence. 

### **Guiding Principles**

* Design around **life events** to deliver contextually relevant workflows.   
* Surface **AI-powered insights** and next-best-actions to reduce friction.   
* Foster a **cohesive**, personalized experience across web, mobile, and SSO entry points. 

### **Discovery: Pain Points & Opportunities**

* **Login & Access**: Users struggle to find the correct portal and reset credentials, driving call-center volume.   
* **Enrollment & Life-Events**: Confusing flows for enrolling and submitting life-event changes.   
* **Claims Submission**: Manual data entry, unclear documentation needs, and opaque denial processes.   
* **Mobile Experience**: Poor responsiveness; unexplained card declines.   
* **Forms & Paper**: Legacy paper/fax forms add unnecessary steps. 

#### **Opportunities**

* **Educate**: De-mystify benefit terms and plan details inline.   
* **Engage**: Leverage an Intelligent Engagement Engine for proactive, personalized prompts. 

### **Experience Structure & IA**

* **Entry Points**: Responsive web, Mobile app, Employer SSO, WEX website.   
* **Core Nav Modules**: Home, Reimbursement Accounts, HSA/Investments, Notional Accounts, HRA, Commuter, Claims, Transactions, Plans, Supplemental Benefits, Resources, Notifications, My Account.   
* **Conditional**: Navigation adapts to enrolled products to minimize clutter. 

### **Homepage Jobs-to-Be-Done**

From recent user testing & surveys:

* View claim status so that I know where it is in the process.  
* View account balances so that I can manage my spending.  
* Check recent transaction history to check for fraud.  
* View my HSA investment account balance. 

### **Key Design Considerations for Homepage**

* **Cards**: Anchor cards for enrolled products with clear, action-oriented labels.   
* **Virtual Agent**: Surface contextual help, next steps, and insights.   
* **Personalization**: Show only relevant modules and actions based on user profile and life events.   
* **Mobile First**: Ensure all elements scale and remain usable on smaller screens.
